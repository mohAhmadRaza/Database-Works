Problem:
Consider p1(a,b) and p2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.
Where,
a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points p1 and p2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

Solution:
SELECT CAST((MAX(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N))+(MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W)) AS DECIMAL(30,4))
FROM STATION;
